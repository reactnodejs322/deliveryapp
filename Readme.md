### Motivation for open-source

This is a **beginner-friendly** open-source project aimed for **social good**. We are always looking for more passionate programmers, like you, to contribute!

Open-source project is powerful because it lowers the barriers to adoption and collaboration, allowing people to spread and improve projects quickly. It also is a perfect place for anyone to hone their programming skills and share their visions and ideas with like-minded others. Here are three major reasons as to why you should contribute to our open-source project!

- **Collaboration**: Open-source project can accept changes from anyone in the world.
- **Adoption**: Open source project can be used by anyone for nearly any purpose.
- **Transparency**: Anyone can inspect an open source project for errors and making small and big improvements.

If you are still confused about the concept of open source and would like to learn more, check out the [**Github's official guide!**](https://github.com/open-source)

### Coding for social good

I am a firm believer that a personal project is **so much more meaningful** if it brings positive impact to the society.

I have always been in awe of people who strive to make a change in the world. The philanthropists and activists on the television, in interviews, and in books inspire me with their radiating passion for what they stand for, and I used to hope that one day I could be passionate enough about something to also create change in the world.

And now, here I am, launching **the first open-source project here on Github**. This is an opportunity for people to connect with others who share the same drive for creating positive changes around us.

### It can be overwhelming

I remember the first time I tried to make contribution to an open-source. The experience was quite overwhelming. There were so many things I did not understand about the project, and I couldn't even understand the command lines that were used for setting up the project.

Even now, I am by no means an experienced programmer. There's still so much I am learning everyday. I started programming about two years ago, and it has been a challenging yet exciting journey. One of my regrets I had along the way was failing to discover the beauty of contributing to an open-source. Somehow in my mind, I always thought that I need to be an experienced developer to be able to contribute. But **THAT IS TOTALLY NOT THE CASE**. All you need is a heart to contribute, a willpower that drives you forward, even after failure, and a faith that you will succeed if you keep at it.

I want to make sure your experience here is a **positive, friendly, and exciting one**. Together we can foster a loving community for developers.

### Join us!

I would **really really encourage you to fork and use this project in whatever way you want. Let's keep spreading love during this challenging time.**

Once you join our project and make your first contribution, we will list you as one of our [**contributors**](https://github.com/reactnodejs32/deliveryapp/graphs/contributors) and add your profile in our [**README.md section**](#Open-source-Team). I truly believe that working on an open-source project will make you a better programmer and communicator, and it will also give you something meaningful to talk about when you talk to a recruiter (if you are going to industry in the future)!

Whether it is because of your **passion for social good**, or your desire to **hone your web programming skills**, or simply to find an opportunity to **gain some experiences programming with others**, we would love to have you.

- We have a discord feel free to email easyrun32@gmail.com to join ! <br />
- If you have any hesitations, questions, or concerns. Feel free to [**send me at email**](mailto:easyrun32@gmail.com). Happy to connect!

## Project Setup 🚀

Now that you've made your decision to make your first contribution. Here's how to set it up.

└── README.md                   # documentation of the shop project
```

### General Setup

### Please ask reactnodejs32 to give you credentials to the project

## Understanding User Authorization ✔️

In our current shop setup, users are able to log in and log out. Users are able to sign in with their **Google account** directly. Alternatively, they are also able to **sign up** using their personal email address and password.

We currently have two types of users: **manager user** and **driver user**.

- The driver logs in with their phone and gets orders from the manager.
- The manager user is able to access the **manager admin panel** and drag orders to drivers

**Cool! Keep hacking!!** 🎉
